Its cracks and crevices are almost entirely filled with colorful forms of plant life, but for some reason, nothing has grown that close to it, enabled you to walk by it to the east and the west as you wish.

To the south, you can see shafts of sunlight flickering down through the treetops, but it also smells thick and damp with humidity, pollen, and spores. A babbling brook crosses the path just east of here. It's barely a few inches deep and so placid that the crossing would be little more than a damp footnote on your journey.</Description>

Thus far, Mhen'ga has not sent its jungles in to claim the small town, but that doesn't mean it won't. The path bends forther to the north and continues straight on to the south. The western building is closed and locked, for now.\n\nTo the east you see one of the many pre-fabricated buildings in the colony, somewhat out of place among the shacks and more nondescript buildings. A pair of industrial stacks spewing out harmless wafts of steam denotes use, while the colorful and somewhat stretched sign up front purpose: <i>Crazy Carl's Crude Cylinder Collection Cache</i>.

		<Description>"Navigation is tricky with so little light to illuminate the way, but the lack of visible light assists you in other ways, keeping brush and undergrowth to an absolute minimum. If you were so inclined, you could easily wander around the gloomy wood. It would be wise not to wander too far, however; you don't want to get lost on such a wild planet. The woodland trail makes a straight line east to west. In the former direction, the forest lightens. In the latter, a small brook crosses the trail. The waters are crystal clear and shallow enough to cross without issue.</Description>

		<Title>DEEP\nJUNGLE</Title>
		<Description>"There is so much pollen in the air here that you can't help but stifle a series of uncontrollable sneezes. The entire place is covered in vines, flowers, and overgrowth that lacks a decent word in your language to describe it. Some of the dangling cords of plant matter even appear to be prehensile, twitching to grap a fist-sized insect out of the air. You hear the crack of an exoskeleton break after. <b>You had best be on guard here.</b></Description>

		<Title>DARK ORANGE\nCORNER</Title>
		<Description>"You stand on the edge of darkness and light (relative to this jungle, anyway). If you follow the path to the west, the forest turns almost unacceptably dark. The canopy above that part of the woods is so dense that only a few, weak beams of light penetrate down to the forest floor. To the north, the woods lighten to a dramatic degree thanks to brilliant, almost neon plant-life that grows on all sides of the well-trod path.</Description>

		<Title>LICHEN\nJUNGLE</Title>
		<Description>"Hardly anything seems to grow here but trees, thorns, and lichens, and the lichens have grown over both of the former. The trees grow so closely together to the north that it would be impossible to squeeze between, while the thorns to the south are so large and thick that getting through them would be a huge pain. Purplish lights twinkle from some of the lichens around you, and it seems like every new step exposes you to a new color or trait from the oddly earth-like, indigenous life-form.</Description>

		<Title>VALLEY\nDESCENT</Title>
		<Description>"The path here heads directly north to south on a steep slant. The more you move south, the more you seem to descend into a natural valley. The trees here seem to be defying the incline, strangely growing taller and thicker the further the path descends.\n\nThis area is thin with mist. It seems to get thicker further down. Even then, you can still see the flickering of the luminous tree lichen.</Description>

		<Title>IRONWOODS\nAND LICHENS</Title>
		<Description>"The jungle here is marvelously colorful. Hues of verdant green swim between vibrant yellows and lurid reds, shining up from the interwoven lichens in a rainbow of beauteous light. Whenever you press down upon some of it, the light brightens, lighting the way as you go. Ferrous trees as big as buildings rise up to the east, and smaller gray ones to the west cluster so tightly that you cannot go in that direction.</Description>

		<Title>IRONWOODS\nAND LICHENS</Title>
		<Description>"Here, dozens of multihued lichens clash against a larger and entirely different type of jungle life. Gigantic trees, each at least a dozen feet around, tower over you. Their rusty red bark gives them a surprisingly familiar appearance until you brush your hand against one. The stuff flakes right off on your fingers! Underneath where you touched shines a silvery metallic color. These trees' bark is literally iron hard.</Description>

		<Description>"You're on a path that winds its way through masses of purple blooms of all sizes and descriptions. Some are almost as big as an average man, others are so tiny you could fit two or three on a pinky finger. Insects swarm around them, content to harvest the flower's nectar instead of bothering you. You're grateful; some of them seem to be packing dangerous-looking stingers. You can go south and west along the path.</Description>

		<Title>SCIENTIST'S\nOFFICE</Title>
		<Description>"The pure white, self-illuminating walls, floor, and ceiling provide a perfectly uniform distribution of luminance, lending the whole space a dream-like, heavenly quality. More strange than the lighting is the desk that curves through the northern half of this chamber. It's carved from one solid piece of translucent material that reflects the light into dazzling patterns of hypnotizing shine. The doorway to the east is the same featureless alabaster. It doesn't even have a doorknob, instead relying on proximity scanners and motorized retractors to slide it out of the way and into the wall. This place feels nothing like the rest of Esbeth.</Description>

A blanket of mist licks your [pc.feet] and steals them from view.\n\nThere is a jutting rock face here with water trickling down it. You can head either north or east.</Description>

		<Title>FERNGROWTH\nPATH</Title>
		<Description>"Hanging ominously overhead, gigantic ferns tower over the path. While this casts the area into deep shadow, it also broadens the navigable area quite nicely, allowing you to see something besides bushy green leaves for a chance. The ground on either side is a deep, rich brown, and moist with water that constantly seems to drip from the plants above. It is bare except for the ferns and flat, round disks that you surmise are mushroom-like in nature.</Description>

		<Description>"Esbeth's single road twists to the south and west here, spoking out in straight lines that run in those directions. The path here is as barren and burned-out as everywhere else in town, but the houses on either side are fresh and new, though a few show places of rust already. To the south, you can see the eastern exit of town splitting off from the roadway. There are occasional other adventurers, like you on their way, but they pay you no mind.</Description>

Seats for two lie in the cockpit, and there is a servicable but small shower near the back. Three bunks are scattered around the cramped interior, providing barely ample room for you and your crew.</Description>

		<Description>"Springing lightly under your [pc.feet] as you move, the soft soil and lichenous mulch below makes your journey surprisingly pleasant, aside from the omnipresent humidity. A wall of gray trees blocks the way west, and a trunk as big as three tanks put together blocks the east. Buzzing insects swirl around everywhere, busy on their own errands. Thankful they don't seem to have much interest in you, perhaps due to your alien physiology.</Description>

		<Title>METAL\nPOD</Title>
		<Description>"Buried halfway in a small crater of its own creation sits an oblong metal pod, perhaps ten feet long and three across. The surface is still glossy after its obviously hot reentry; you can see the way it blackened the ground and the plants around it. You immediately recognize it as one of the probes your father sent out - one of the keys to his fortune.</Description>

		<Title>LICHEN\nJUNGLE</Title>
		<Description>"There is little plant-growth here aside from the multi-hued lichens that drape everything in their almost luminescent hues, yet somehow a group of gray-barked trees has managed to endure in the center of it all, clustered closely enough to block anyone not driving a lumber harvester. Thick thorns obscure the way north from view. Luckily, the open path you now stand upon continues both east and west of here, though it opens up for more in the former direction.</Description>
