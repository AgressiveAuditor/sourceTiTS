Hell, they’re not much more than biplanes with machine guns strapped to the open cockpits. The planes fall in around you, forcing you to slow to a veritable crawl to keep from crashing into them; one of the planes comes almost level with your cockpit, and the pilot gives you a friendly wave from one of her four arms. You blink as you see a pair of large, insectile antenna whipping in the wind over her head, poking out from an old-school aviator’s cap.");

That turns out to be exactly what it is, you see as you near it: an exceptionally large airport whose planes have mostly been pushed aside or hangared, giving way to a handful of pioneer-looking starships, freighters, and military transports from the battle group in orbit.");
		output("\n\nYou’re allowed to break off from the planes once you reach the airfield, guiding your ship in a simple vertical landing as the biplanes make use of the one clear runway left. You park your ship, collect your gear, and punch the boarding ramp down. You’re quickly greeted by a group of armed women, all four-armed, antenna-bearing, and abnormally busty beauties clad in military uniforms. ");
