Implementation Notes (For Fen and Geddy)

Given Bess/Ben's stupidly huge size (Over 350 Pages and 95k words), it's best if this content is broken into chunks of release. You know, for sanity reasons.

Their initial pick-up, general sex scenes, and body modifications are pretty core. These would probably be best for a first release. That actually makes up a fairly small percentage of the overall content (30k).

The story doc makes up the biggest chunk of the content (40k) and is fairly stand alone. You can delay implementing this in the first release. Since the Lovers Sex Scenes and some Discussion Topics (such as Karaoke and Grav Ball) are also tied to the story path, you can put this on the back burner until the later story content is added.

This also means you don't have to implement all the nitty gritty finicky things, like the Bess?Ben Follower Perks etc, since these are all tied to the mid to late Story Path as well. Pretty much that entire Story Doc can be ignored for first-time release except for the 'Bess/Ben On Tarkus' bit at the end.

Their clothing options are tied in to a lot of things, but I don't know if the items have to exist if they're going to be excluded by an if statement anyway. If not, that's something that might not be essential for a first-time release. Same goes for cock types.

There are entries in the sex scenes for paths that don't exist yet (Such as the 'BessCumDump') flag. These are planned for a later date. Rather than add each entry individually once the scene is in game, figured I'd enter them in advance.

The 'Bess Affection' score comes into play when story events unfold. His/Her variant greeting dialogue only kicks in once these events have progressed to a certain point. Because of this, you can skip putting in the Affection stat until the story is being implemented.

General Storyline

The PC finds an abandoned Bess-13 or Ben-14 Model (Depending on PC choice on discovery) in a trash pile on Tarkus. Why someone has abandoned such a valuable android is a complete mystery. 

They appear to be in working order except their power cells need to be recharged, which can only be done by bringing them to the player’s ship. Thankfully, the android is surprisingly light.

Should the PC drag the android back to the ship it is a relatively simple process to recharge them. Upon restarting, she undergoes a factory settings reset - wiping their memory of what happened, and also making the PC her new owner. The PC can then name the unit, or use their default name "Bess/Ben". 

"Bess/Ben" then explains that they are a Bess-13 or Ben-14 Unit, designed by JoyCo to give relief to those with the need to breed. The PC can take advantage of their multiple functions in order to gain "breeding relief". They can also customize their appearance so that they act as the perfect "sex substitute".

Bess/Ben is an AI designed with emotional archives to make them a better sex-substitute. While newer models of the 13's and 14’s had the ability for emotional attachment removed and their processors replaced with VIs, Bess/Ben is one of the first released units of the model line. PCs that treat Bess/Ben well will increase their affection score, leading to them having feelings for them beyond just breeding relief (such as friendship or love).

Bess/Ben, as an AI with emotional modules, has certain personality features that VIs and coded AIs lack. Once they begins to open up to you and realises it is okay to have a personality, the PC will find they are genuinely empathic, cheeky and curious. They fret a lot about other people, and while they love winding people up, they hate being wound up themself (except in a sexual way).

The PC may also discover that they have an incredibly voracious sexual appetite. All the early Bess-13 and Ben-14 models were given an extremely high pleasure feedback rate from sex and physical contact. They were also equipped with mechanical levels of stamina. This was the flaw in the original Bess-13 units that caused many unsatisfied units to go rogue (See Bess-13 and Ben-14 Codex History).

The PC can encourage or discourage Bess/Ben to develop their own personality, teaching them about certain things and expanding their their mind beyond mere sexual relief services. Kind/Mischievous/Hard PCs will give different answers, but as long as the underlying theme is the same (acceptance and encouragement) Bess/Ben will end up becoming friends with them. The PC will then have the opportunity to take things further and become their lover.

The lover path explores darker aspects of galactic society, such as prejudice and persecution

* This is currently only coming up at the end of the core story content. Bess's sexual appetite will be explored via modular story content.
Story Mapping

Finished Paths

Normal Path -> Friendship Path -> Lover Path 
+------> Fall-off Normal/Friendship Path

Planned Paths

Continued Lovers Path: The extension of existing Lovers content.

Parenthood Path: Exploring parenthood by purchasing and using the GX upgrade.

Cum Slut Path: Turning Bess/Ben into a sex-addicted, public use sex sleeve.
* Include "Bad Ending" for if you don't allow her to be public use *and* leave her unsatiated.

Revolutionary Path: Bess/Ben is learning to make a life for herself outside the PC. They begin to realise the difficult path that they will have to walk as a sapient AI and begins to feel a social obligation to "change" the status quo.

Coded AI Path: Get Bess/Ben to embrace their more mechanical aspects. Possible 'Pirate AI Path' once you get her to abandon ethics.


Continued Lovers Path
Tastebud Cooking Scene
More Stuff
Proposal 

PARENTHOOD PATH
Bess/Ben informs you about the potential to buy them a gene splicer upgrade, allowing them to impregnate/get impregnated by the PC.
A talk about your plans for the kid, and if they will be "just another one" like your dads kids or truly treasured. Probably a deal breaker for Bess/Ben to actually go through with this path, PC might have the chance to get angry for them thinking about him/her that way. Wants to be ‘speshul’ and not just ship off the kid to mass daycare.
Knock-you-up sex! Probably need to edit the sex scenes to fit the new dynamic involving Bess pregnancy.
Touch belly.
Elements: Belly Touching, Hormonal Reactions ("Bess, why did you program that into yourself?" "I wanted the authentic experience!!") - cravings, grumpiness etc. All the shit that never gets mentioned when you knock someone up.
Birth, ofc. Choosing Gender, baby name.
Baby is crying and don’t know why, Bess/Ben wonders why nobody ever translated Baby.
Who gets up to deal with the crying kid? Is it the PC, Bess, Celise--?
Bess/Ben maaaaaaay have done a bit of genetic manipulation on the kid to make them good with computers and give them the best competitive advantages possible. I mean, worked for you right? Promise you won’t get mad--?

THE FUTURE..,?
Bess/Ben asks the PC where they see their future together

It seems [Bess] needs to induce lactation in a very similar way to a nursing mother. There's a good chance JoyCo, being a medical company, thought it was important for [Bess] to know this particular method. That, or the more likely scenario; [Bess]'s developers were just a bunch of pregophiles.

Cupping one of [bess.hisHer] [bess.breastLight] in one hand, [Bess] begins to gently stroke it like a mother stimulating prolactin. [bess.HeShe] methodically massages each and every part with a flushing expression. 

The {[bess.hairColor] haired/bald synthetic} seems keenly aware of your eyes on [bess.hisHer] every action, lewdly watching [bess.himHer] massage [bess.hisHer] {tiny/modest/ample/mountainous} mounds.

<i>\"Kind of feels weird having you watch me like this. I feel a bit tingly...\"</i> [Bess] remarks as [bess.heShe] touches [bess.himHer]self in front of you. You remark that [bess.heShe] is spending a lot of time on one breast, and {male android/android girl} huffs.

<i>\"Well of course, I've only got two hands!\"</i> That's an easily solved problem. You move up behind [bess.himHer] and reach around, gently caressing her other [bess.breastNoun]. 

You feel [bess.himHer] stiffen up at first in surprise, and then relax into your chest with a pleasured sigh. With [bess.himHer] massaging one and you the other, it's going to take half the time. 

It's not long before you feel [Bess]'s [bess.assSize] ass unconsciously rubbing against your crotch. [Bess.HeShe] seems to be getting really worked up by having [bess.hisHer] [bess.breastsLight] milked.

[Bess.HisHer] own hands shift underneath [bess.hisHer] [bess.breastsLight] and begin to massage them while you tease [bess.hisHer] [bess.nipples]. It's not long before they're bubbling with [bess.milk], [bess.hisHer] frothy fluid pouring down her supple breast flesh and running across your teasing fingers.

Your hands reach up and grab the back of [bess.hisHer] head, holding onto it as you explosively cum against [bess.hisHer] lips.
}

[Bess] lets out a low, trembling moan as [bess.heShe] takes your {girl} spunk to the face. In the process of you cumming and playing with [bess.hisHer] tits [bess.heShe] also creams [bess.himHer]self{if (bess.hasCock) ", [bess.hisHer] [bess.cock] shooting [bess.hisHer] [bess.cum] all over the place."}{else if (bess.hasPussy) ", [bess.hisHer] [bess.pussy] shooting [bess.hisHer] [bess.girlCum] all over the place."}{else: "."} [Bess.HisHer] [bess.nipples] fire spastic spurts of [bess.milk] everywhere, almost like a separate ejaculation of their own.


Afterwards [Bess] wipes off [bess.hisHer] face. There is a truly intoxicated look in [bess.hisHer] [bess.eyeColor] eyes, almost as if [bess.heShe]'s utterly drunk off playing with [bess.hisHer] [bess.nipplesNoun] and giving you head.}

[Bess] shudders in your arms and suddenly creams [bess.himHer]self. It seems [bess.hisHer] nipples really are sensitive, especially when [bess.heShe]'s lactating!

<i>\"I guess that that, then? Maybe my designers weren't so crazy after all.</i> [Bess] states in a dreamy voice, [bess.milk] drooling from [bess.hisHer] [bess.nipplesLight]. It's definitely a different kind of 'on' switch.

<b>[Bess] is now lactating from [bess.hisHer] [bess.nipplesNoun]!</b>


Don't Lactate

<i>\"Wha-- don't lactate any more?</i> [Bess] sounds thoroughly disappointed. It seems the {male synthetic/synthetic girl} really likes leaking [bess.milk] from [bess.hisHer] breasts.

<i>\"... Oh well. I guess it </i>is<i> a waste of my resources if you aren't going to enjoy it.\"</i> [Bess.HeShe] grudgingly concedes. With a simple tweak of [bess.hisHer] nipples, [bess.hisHer] milk suddenly stops flowing.

... What, <i>that's it</i>? No kinky breast massages, nothing? Seems it's a lot simpler to turn that mode on than it is to turn it off again.

[If (bess.gender = female) "Wearing the world's biggest pout"}{else: "With a downhearted sigh"}, [Bess] goes off to look for something else to do. At least the ship will be saving money on breast pads.

(First time: Shift it using her JoyCord? You're not sure what [bess.heShe] means...")

The {male synthetic/synthetic girl} lies on [bess.hisHer] back and spreads [bess.hisHer] thighs. [Bess.HeShe then raises [bess.hisHer] ass and hips off the ground, lewdly exposing [bess.hisHer] [bess.crotch] to you.

<i>\"... I've got to directly pump it into my {If ButtIncrease or bess.hasPussy = false: [bess.assNoun]}{else: [bess.pussyNoun]} using my JoyCord.

Once it is fully inside of [bess.himHer] you hear an audible sloshing noise. Suddenly lumps are moving along the prehensile pipe and pumping directly into [bess.hisHer] {[bess.ass]/[bess.pussy]}.

In the end [bess.hisHer] own spurting cock is dislodged from the pressure of [bess.hisHer] gushing fluid, bursting out of [bess.hisHer] {ass/pussy} and spilling all over the floor.

You decide you’d like to equip [Bess] with the plant cock attachment you purchased from JoyCo. Technically it’s not a plant cock so much as a \"bio-organic construct\" grown in a lab, and genetically designed to feed off of [Bess]’s internal Meld-Milk supply. 

Pulling it out of the cryo-stasis canister it came in, you then fasten it to [Bess]’s crotch extension slot, watching it slowly awaken and bury its roots into [bess.hisHer] body.

The packaging said it was based on an organism discovered on one of the outer rim planets, known for mating with both plant and mammalian life-forms. [bess.HisHer] base is a giant open blossom, while in the middle of the petals is a phallic looking stamen with a bulbous head. 

As the mysterious organism feeds off [bess.hisHer] Meld-Milk it begins to generate pollen contained in a gooey sap. The amber fluid leaks freely from [bess.hisHer] pod-like tip or "anther", and dribbles down [bess.hisHer] new shaft.

<i>\"It kind of tingles, [bNamePC]. I can feel it suckling off me - I can’t say it’s unpleasant.\"</i> [Bess] informs you, testing and flexing [bess.hisHer] symbiotic rod. <i>\"I can’t believe they grew this; isn’t JoyCo just amazing?\"</i> 


<b> [Bess] now has a Plant Cock!</b>


Dragon Cock Equip Message

You decide you’d like to equip [Bess] with the draconic cock attachment you purchased from JoyCo. When you see it, your immediate impression is this cock is positively majestic in its appearance; truly the phallus of a mythical beast.

The draconic cock’s tapered tip hooks like a crescent curving upwards - you imagine there’s very few holes it couldn’t stick into. The muscled and studded base is considerably thicker than the head, it considerably thickens and curves as your eyes travel down the muscled, studded base, each throbbing curve a promise of intense sexual pleasure. 

if (bess.hasKnot = false)
(
[Bess]'s dragon cock has a knot, but since you don't like them [bess.heShe] immediately shrinks it away. 
}
else
{
Down near the base is a draconic bulb-like knot. Just beyond the base is a sudden lack of girth before [bess.hisHer] cock connects to [bess.hisHer] waist - here the cock is half the size of the actual knot. If one wasn’t careful, a clenching orifice might hook into this deep spot and refuse to unfasten until the fierce phallus has become completely flaccid.
}
Once it is attached, [Bess] flexes [bess.hisHer] new cock. As it expands [bess.hisHer] eyes do the same. <i>\"This is really something else, [bNamePC]! I kind of feel fierce when I’m wearing this, like nothing can stop me...\"</i>

<b> [Bess] now has a draconic cock and balls!</b>

Pussy 

<i>\"Did you want me to {have a pussy/get rid of my pussy, [bNamePC]?\"</i> [Bess] asks.

[Yes] [No]

Remove Pussy

In what can only be described as bizarre to watch, [Bess]'s silvery vagina moves up just slightly into her body. A skin covered panel then slides down and out, pressing into the empty spot and filling the gap. What is left is a perfectly smooth groin area. 

<b>[Bess] no longer has a [bess.pussyNounLight]!</b>
Add Pussy

In what can only be described as bizarre to watch, [Bess]'s flat groin slides in and up, like a hatch opening. From inside a silvery vagina pushes out, filling the gap. 

<b>[Bess] now has a [bess.pussyNounLight]!</b>

Cock Knot

<i>\"Did you want me to {get rid of my knot/have a knot}, [bNamePC]?\"</i> [Bess] asks.

[Yes] [No]

Add Knot

[Bess]'s [bess.cock] suddenly begins to flare at the base. The entire process takes mere moments. Afterwards. [bess.heShe] has a muscular lump at the stem of [bess.hisHer] [bess.cockNounSimple].

Flexing it and watching it swell and recede, [Bess] gives a small grin. <i>\"Wow, I could trap anyone with this! Fancy a ride, [bNamePC]?\"</i>

<b>[Bess]'s [bess.cockNounSimple] now has a [bess.knot]!</b>

Remove Knot

Within seconds of your request being issued, [Bess]'s [bess.knot] shrinks until it is completely gone. The signiture lump is now missing from the base of [bess.hisHer] [bess.cockNounSimple].

<b>[Bess] no longer has a knot!</b>


Cum

<i>\"My cum? Which one in particular...?\"</i> [Bess] asks.

[Cum Flavor] [Girl Cum Flavor]


Cum / Girl Cum Flavor

<i>\"Flavoring is a cinch. Any particular taste you'd fancy? I could give you test tastings, if you want.\"</i> [Bess] offers.

[Normal] [Chocolate] [Candy] [Coffee] [Vanilla] 
[Strawberry] [Caramel] [Banana] [Coconut] [Maple Syrup]
[Cherry] [Choc-vanilla] [Whisky] [Honey] [Rum]
[Vodka] [Beer] [Orange] [Blueberry] [Raspberry]
[Lime] 


Change message

There are no obvious outward signs other than a short period of blinking by the {male synthetic/android girl}.

<i>\"... All done! Next time I cum, it will taste {[bess.cumFlav]/[bess.girlCumFlav]}!</i> [Bess] cheerfully exclaims.

<b>[Bess]'s {cum/girl cum} now tastes like {[bess.cumFlav]/[bess.girlCumFlav]}!<\b>
